Rules in my discord server...


1. In the music section it will be where everyone can attend to listen to music.

2. Never abuse if you are ranks higher than the rest, since that would be given to ban or remain.

3. Never ask permission to speak, read or other things on a private channel ...

IF IT IS PRIVATE IT WILL BE FOR SOMETHING

4. If you are super fans of the server, you can follow our news channel #ðŸ—’notices
[1:57 PM]
5. Do not insult or use bad words or PBot will penalize you.

6. Spam is only allowed in #âš spam , and PBot will also penalize you if you do it outside of that section.

7. Suggestions to try to improve this server are appreciated. If you have a problem, do not forget to put in #ðŸ™‚help  We will respond as soon as possible!

8. If possible, to listen to music go to the MUSIC section and in the MUSIC sound section enter and to play it, put the one you need in #ðŸŽµmusicðŸŽµ .

9. Never ask for the SuperFan role since I see that if you follow the rules and never ask, and Owner can only be me.

10. In #ðŸ˜Žfunny-things  you can put memes.

11. If you say something that creators / friends do not like, and you have said something that is not appropriate for minors, it could be that the channel where it was said, becomes private, and you will have to verify the age. Be careful with what you say!

12. Never mention a role or PERSON if you do not know what you do or if it is only #ðŸ™‚help  @Staff and you are in the category offered exclusively for it.
